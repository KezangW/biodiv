TaxonRecordID			Unique identifier of the record within the database.				0							sp code
GlobalUniqueIdentifier			According to DarwinCore: An Uniform Resource Name (URN) used as an unique identifier of the taxon record. Recommended to use a globally unique identifier (GUID) to unambiguously refer to the resource. If an identifier is not provided it will be very difficult to update a resource and preserve linked information. For example, if an object’s metadata is changed, there will not be enough information to determine the newer object is an updated form of an older object unless they share a dc:identifier. It will be assumed the older object was removed and a new one was added, and any annotations associated with the original object will be lost.
